# Plant Disease Detection Web App

## Project Overview
The **Plant Disease Detection Web App** is a machine learning-based application that can identify plant diseases from images. It uses the YOLOv8 object detection model for disease detection and provides valuable information such as disease descriptions, prevention methods, and product recommendations (e.g., pesticides and fertilizers) from sources like Wikipedia and Amazon India.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Upload an image of a plant for disease detection.
- **Disease Detection**: Use the YOLOv8 model to detect diseases.
- **Information Retrieval**: Fetch detailed disease descriptions from Wikipedia.
- **Product Recommendations**: Search for relevant products from Amazon India for disease prevention and treatment.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.

## Model Training
### Data Collection
The model was trained using a dataset containing images of healthy plants and plants affected by various diseases. The dataset was sourced from public plant disease repositories and augmented to improve model robustness.

### Model Architecture
The core of the detection system is the **YOLOv8** model, which is well-suited for real-time object detection due to its balance of speed and accuracy. The model was trained using [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov8) library.

### Training Process
1. **Preprocessing**: Image data was preprocessed to standardize input dimensions.
2. **Augmentation**: Image augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, rotation, and scaling) were applied to increase the model's generalization capabilities.
3. **Training Configuration**:
   - **Batch Size**: 16
   - **Learning Rate**: 0.001
   - **Epochs**: 50
   - **Optimizer**: Adam
4. **Evaluation**: The model was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics on a validation set.

### Model File
The trained model is available as `last (2).pt` in the `model/` directory.
